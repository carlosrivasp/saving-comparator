# ðŸ“Š CLI Tools â€” Saving Comparator

This folder contains **command-line Python scripts** for comparing remunerated bank accounts available for contracting in Spain.

Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific bank or financial product, containing its own comparator script.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

cli/
â”œâ”€â”€ revolut/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ revolut_comparator.py
â”œâ”€â”€ tbd-comparator/
|    â””â”€â”€ tbd_plans.py

## ðŸ“Œ How to use

1. Install dependencies (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt

2. Run any script from its folder:
    ```bash
    python revolut/revolut_comparator.py

The scripts run via terminal input and generate comparative charts using Matplotlib.

## ðŸ“ƒ Notes
These tools are intended for use in command-line interfaces (CLI) like VS Code terminal, PowerShell, or any Python environment.

No web interface or Streamlit app is included here â€” see the /web folder for that.
